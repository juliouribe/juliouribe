<h1 align='center'>Hello, I'm Julio! 👋</h1>

I'm a first generation Mexican-American 🇲🇽 🇺🇸 software engineer based in San Francisco, CA. I've been working in the self driving industry since 2015 first working in operations and most recently as a software engineer.

I was first interested in coding back in 2013 while I was in my junior year of college at UC Santa Cruz. I was a psychology major taking a class called, "Programming for the Cognitive Sciences". We were working on a driving simulator and needed to slow down the simulator to resemble a human driver by adding cognitive functions such as change detection, color recognition, and sending muscular neural signals. I was blown away that we could simulate psychology experiments and also automate the reporting. I wanted to switch to being a computer science major but couldn't due to lack of financial support.

Instead I jumped into the job market when I graduated. I started working in operations for self driving companies such as Waymo, Uber, Ike, and Nuro. I taught myself how to code and at my most recent two jobs I've been writing code to build web pages and assist with simulation post processing steps via ETL pipelines. I've worked on dashboards for workflows that assisted with data labeling as well and simulation validation. These workflows would help train the autonomy software and let us evaluate it's improvement.

Most recently I completed a full stack web dev bootcamp to supplement my skills as a software engineer. I graduated from App Academy's 16 week full stack in person bootcamp. I can now build projects using Javascript, React with Redux, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. With these new skills and my previous experience using Python, Django, and working with cloud providers like Google Cloud Platform I feel like a strong candidate for most web dev roles.

Feel free to reach out! I'm always happy to talk about web development. In my free time I follow Formula 1 🏎 and enjoy watching old movies 🎥 🍿. I root for Ferrari in F1 and Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director.
