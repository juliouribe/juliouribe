### Hello 👋, I'm Julio

I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco and I have been working in the self driving industry for 8 years. I love problem solving and building things. My skills are in web development. I have experience building full stack projects with Javascript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, Django, and PostgreSQL.

In my spare time I like to follow Formula 1 🏎 and watch old movies 🎥 🍿. My favorite F1 team is Ferrari and my favorite movies are Mulholland Drive and 2001 Space Odyssey.
